# Unit 2: Apps, Websites, and the Internet

Almot anything you do on a computer, phone, or other device will involve using an app, the internet, or oftentimes both. You may not know it, but you are already using an app right now to read this!

We put this section near the beginning for two reasons.

1. Understanding some of the later topics, such as internet safety, email, and using the cloud, all rely on a basic understanding of apps and the internet. It will be difficult to understand those topics if you don't understand the content in this section.

2. Knowing how to use the internet can help you in your technology learning process.
   This is because the internet is full of information on other types of technology. When you run into something you don't know how to do, or face an issue, the internet will have the information you are looking for. So, once you gain the skill of finding information on the internet, you can use that information to learn many more technical skills!

**Note:** The tablet you are using will have many of its apps disabled, and will not be able to connect to the internet. Unfortunately, this means you won't be able to do many things described in this section, like making an internet search or downloading an app.

However, the information in this section may still be useful to you! You can use it in the future if your access to technology increases. It can also help you understand things you hear people talk about, like “googling” things, or using social media apps.
