The internet is a very large, interconnected network of computers and other devices. These devices can send data to each other, which allows for worldwide exchange of information. Devices can send signals over long distances through wires and satellite signals. They can also send signals over short distances using wireless networks called Wi-Fi networks. Computers are very useful devices on their own, but a large network of computers is even more useful. The internet can be used for many purposes, such as communication, education, and entertainment.

To send and receive information on the internet, you have to use a device that is connected to the internet.

## Connecting to the internet:

You can connect a device to the internet using wired or wireless methods. One of the most common ways is through Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi uses radio waves to send information, meaning that the connection is invisible and there are no cords/cables involved. Another common method is using an ethernet cable, which is a cord that plugs into your device.

If you use a computer that belongs to an organization like a library or community center, it will likely already be connected to the internet. If you buy your own device, such as a computer or mobile phone, you will have to connect it to the internet yourself.

Many public spaces like libraries, schools, restaurants, and airports have free public Wi-Fi. If you are near or inside one of these buildings, you can connect your device to their Wi-Fi network and get free internet access! The symbol for Wi-Fi is made up of curved lines - three examples of this symbol are shown below. You may see this symbol in the windows of businesses - this indicates that they provide free Wi-Fi.

**Note:** There are risks to using public Wi-Fi networks. [Unit 4: Staying Safe](../4-staying-safe/index.md) has more information on precautions you can take to keep your information safe. However, before we get to that unit, there is still more to learn in this unit about internet and app basics.

If you have an apartment or house, you may want to set up a Wi-Fi network in your home so you can use the internet. To do this, you would contact an internet service provider, such as Bell or Rogers. They can provide information about what your options are and how much they will cost.

To access Wi-Fi, you often need a password to connect. If you connect to Wi-Fi once, for instance at your house, your device will probably connect again next time you are there.

Most phones and tablets will show a Wi-Fi symbol at the top of the screen when you are connected to a Wi-Fi network, as shown in the image below. Since the tablet you are using has internet access disabled, you should not see this symbol.

The term 'online' is often used when talking about connections to the internet. When something is "available online," it means you must be connected to the internet to access it. When a person is online, it means they are currently using an internet connection and can be reached by other people.
