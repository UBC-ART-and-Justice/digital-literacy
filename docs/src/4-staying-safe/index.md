# Unit 4: Staying Safe

You can do so much while using computers and the internet. Tasks that were previously done with paper, such as banking, shopping or business, can now be done digitally! However, just as before, you need to be careful when doing important things in order to be safe. It is possible for others to take your money or personal information if you are not careful.

This is true for everyone! Sometimes on the news, you might hear about people being “hacked” or or having their “data stolen”. However, there are some simple things you can do to stay safe. Just like how you might lock your front door as a good habit, there are some habits to keep your digital life safe.

## Extra Information

You don’t need to know everything!

You don’t need to understand how a lock works before you use it, and you don’t need to understand how all of this works either. In this section, we have included additional information that you can read if you are interested. **If you are not interested, you can skip it!**

The extra information will be inside a box like this. To read it, tap on the box:

??? extra-info "Why would I want to know more?"

    Sometimes the extra information can help you understand the topic better.

    Sometimes it's just cool to know how things work!
