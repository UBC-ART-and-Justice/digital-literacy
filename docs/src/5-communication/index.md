# Unit 1: Communication

This section covers different ways of using technology to communicate with others. These ways include email, texting, social media, and more. We will describe the features, uses, and relevant terminology for each communication type. We have not included step-by-step instructions for using each communication method. This is because technology evolves quickly, and the instructions would soon become outdated.

**Please note:** This section frequently mentions the internet, apps, and websites. This is because social media relies on the existence of these technologies. If these concepts are unfamiliar, you may want to read the section on Apps, Websites, and The Internet. You can come back to this section afterwards and it should make more sense!
