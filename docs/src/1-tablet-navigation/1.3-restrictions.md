# Restrictions

Many of the tablet capabilities have been disabled for security reasons.

This means you will not be able to do things such as:

1. Connect to the internet
2. Use the camera
3. Use most apps that would usually come on a tablet

For learning purposes, it would be ideal to practice applying the knowledge gained from the content. However, this will not be possible for most of the concepts discussed.

It would get repetitive to mention the tablets' lack of access every time it comes up, so we won't do that. When we say something like "You can look this up on the internet to learn more," what we really mean is "In the future, if you get a chance to use the technology being discussed, then you'll probably also have access to the internet at that time, and you can use it to learn more."
