# Restrictions

Many of the tablet capabilities have been disabled for security reasons.

This means you will not be able to:

1. Connect to the internet
2. Use the camera
3. Save and share files

For learning purposes, it would be ideal to practice applying the knowledge gained from the content. However, this will not be possible for most of the concepts discussed.
