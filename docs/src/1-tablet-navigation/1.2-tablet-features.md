Unit 1 | Navigating Your Tablet

# Features and Settings

## Icons

There are some icons at the top of the tablet screen that tell you different things about the tablet. The most relevant icon to you is the battery icon in the top right.

**Tablet is charging:**

![Battery lightning bolt – Tablet is charging](/course/1-tablet-navigation/charging-icon.png){ data-zoomable }

This tells you that the charging cable is connected and the tablet battery is charging.

**Battery has been used up:**

![Battery Red Exclamation Mark icon – Battery has also been used up](/course/1-tablet-navigation/low-battery-icon.png){ data-zoomable }

This tells you that the battery has been used up and is in need of charging.

## Adjusting settings

### How to make text bigger:

If the text size is too big or small for you, you can adjust it by following these steps:

1. Swipe down from the top of the screen. You should see some icons.
2. Swipe down again from the top of the screen. There should now be more icons.
3. The bottom right icon should be a gear icon. Click this to open settings.
4. Scroll down and click on `Display`.
5. Click on `Font size`.
6. Drag the slider to make text bigger or smaller.
7. When you are satisfied with the text size, tap the back arrow to save.

### How to adjust the brightness:

If the screen is too bright or dim, you can adjust the brightness with these steps:

1. Swipe down from the top of the screen. This should make some icons appear.
2. Click the sun icon.
3. Click on the slider and drag your finder to the left to decrease the brightness, or to the right to increase the brighness.

### How to adjust the volume:

There is no audio included in the content, so volume will likely not be an issue. However, if you do want to adjust the volume, it can be done.

There are two buttons on the right side of the tablet above the power (on/off) button. The upper one is used for increasing the volume, and the lower one is used for decreasing the volume. When you click either of these buttons, a slider will appear on the tablet screen. You can also use this slider to adjust the volume by putting your finger on it and dragging up or down.
