For the past two years, ART & Justice has been part of a collaborative project with artists inside correctional facilities and secondary school students. At the start of the project, ART & Justice delivered 15 art kits to interested individuals within a carceral institution and made additional kits available to anyone who expressed interest. The participating artists were then invited to co-create a piece of art with the students by painting half of a canvas. Once their half was complete, a team member retrieved it and brought it to the secondary school, where the students finished the other half in response to the initial work on the canvas. The final artwork was later shared in a public art show and exhibited within the institution.
