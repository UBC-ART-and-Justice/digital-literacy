Organized by Action, Reciprocity, Transformation (A.R.T) & Justice, a research team based out of the UBC, School of Nursing, working in partnership with Correctional Service of Canada. Created by anonymous artists & storytellers in prison across BC

Inspired by the important artistic voice and vision of people in prison, and aiming to reduce feelings of hopelessness and social exclusion exacerbated by the daily realities of incarceration during COVID-19, the A.R.T. & Justice team - in partnership with Correctional Service of Canada - gifted art kits to people in federal prisons across BC. These gifts were to let people know they were not forgotten, provide some comfort, and offer opportunities to create community through art. This exhibition honours their work and invites you to reposition yourself, from a passive viewer to an active participant in social change - to build community along with us.
