Inspired by the artistic voice and vision of currently and previously incarcerated peoples, and aiming to reduce feelings of hopelessness and social exclusion exacerbated by the daily realities of incarceration, the A.R.T. & Justice team has been gifting art supplies to people in prisons across BC since 2020. These gifts are to remind people they are not forgotten, provide comfort, and offer opportunities to create community through art. This exhibition – shift - honours their work and invites you to reposition yourself - from a passive viewer to an active participant in social change - to build community along with us.
