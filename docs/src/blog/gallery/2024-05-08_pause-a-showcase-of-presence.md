Inspired by the concept of pause, pausing and paused. To pause is to take a breath, to rest. A place for processing, talking and building connections.  It can mean getting in touch with nature through grounding practices. It is the action of placing yourself in a solid and safe place. We pause to take a break from daily challenges, to feel the safety of stillness, and to continue the journey to our end goal.  When you are creating art, you pause, fixed in your space to create. You pause – process your emotions - and funnel them into a new form. This exhibition – ***pause*** - honours the work of currently and previously incarcerated peoples. We invite you to think about how you pause before, during, and after  pondering the wonderful, emotional, and fringe line art at Queen’s Park Gallery.

The A.R.T. & Justice team has been gifting art supplies to people in prisons across BC since 2020. These gifts are to remind people they are not forgotten, provide comfort, and offer opportunities to create community through art.
