## Technical Details

The website was created with Vitepress, and the Android app was built by adding Capacitor to the project. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, and the Android app will be available as release APKs on this repository. Future iOS development and releases on app stores (Google Play, F-Droid, Apple App Store) are possible.

The focus of this project is to create an accessible and open-source digital literacy resource that can run offline. The website is intended to be mobile-friendly.
